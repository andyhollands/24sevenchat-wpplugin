24Seven.Chat WordPress plugin
###################

24Seven chat is php web app built on the CodeIgniter framework that allows users to chat to customers in real time on multipage websites. It is forked from the original version of HumblAbode chat and merged with the multipage grouped version originally built for 24Seven Digital.
The 24seven.chat dashboard has a visual representation of the users on the site and displays length of visit and other related stats.

This WordPress plugin adds a small snippet of code into the users website header which references a .js and .css file and a <div> is inserted with the livechat ID
